## Design pattern 

- **A design pattern**: A design pattern in software development is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Design patterns capture solutions that have evolved over time and are considered best practices.

- **Types of Design Patterns**:
  - Creational Patterns: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.
  - Structural Patterns: These patterns deal with object composition, providing ways to form objects structures. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.
  - Behavioral Patterns: These patterns deal with object collaboration and how objects interact. Examples include Observer, Strategy, Template Method, Command, State.

- **Benefits of Design Patterns**:
  - Reusability: Design patterns can be reused in multiple projects.
  - Scalability: Patterns can help in scaling the application.
  - Maintainability: Patterns make the code easier to maintain and understand.
  - Performance: Some patterns can help in improving the performance of the application.
## Builder Pattern
 - **Builder Pattern**: The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. 
## Builder Pattern Goal
  - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
## Builder Pattern Key Components 
 - **Builder**: An interface or abstract class that defines the steps for constructing the product.
 - **Concrete Builder**: Classes that implement the Builder interface and provide specific implementations for building the product.
 - **Director**: Coordinates the construction process using the Builder.
 - **Product**: The complex object being constructed.

## Builder Pattern Implementation

 - Define the Product: Create a class that represents the complex object to be built.
 - Create the Builder Interface: Define an interface that specifies the methods for building different parts of the product.
 - Create Concrete Builders: Implement the Builder interface with concrete classes that specify how to build the product.
 - Create the Director (optional): If needed, create a Director class that orchestrates the construction process using a Builder.
 - Client Code: Use the Builder to construct the product step by step or delegate the construction process to the Director.

## Builder Pattern Use Cases 

  - When an object requires complex construction with multiple steps.
  - When the construction process needs to be independent of the final product.
  - When different representations of a product need to be created using the same construction process.

## Builder Pattern Benefits 
  - Allows the construction of complex objects to be encapsulated within a separate object.
  - Provides flexibility in constructing different representations of the same object.
  - Helps in ensuring that the construction process follows a specific sequence.
## Builder pattern Drawbacks 
  - Adds complexity to the codebase by introducing multiple classes for building objects.
  - Requires defining additional classes for the Builder, Concrete Builder, and potentially a Director.



## Summary
- The Builder Design Pattern is particularly useful when the construction of complex objects involves multiple steps or when different representations of a product are required using the same construction process. It promotes separation of concerns and makes the construction process more flexible and scalable.
